Scheduled maintenance message examples and inspiration


A well run service needs routine maintenance. Without regular system maintenance, updates would go uninstalled, bugs would go unsquashed, patches would go … unpatched.

It’s important for the long-term reliability of your service that ops teams and system administrators feel confident and empowered about announcing maintenance activities.

Whether you’re running a public service on the web or an internal service for your team, announcing downtime is never easy. Unfortunately, many teams don’t take the right approach. Offering the briefest update possible and hoping nobody notices – what you could call the slide-under-the-radar method – actually sets you up for failure.

The goal of a planned maintenance announcement should be to get the right people informed and confident about the upcoming maintenance.

Here’s our guide to announcing scheduled maintenance, along with some examples from our friends who are doing it well.
